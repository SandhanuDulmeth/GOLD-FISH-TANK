                        <li>The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order
                            Cypriniformes.
                            It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most popular aquarium
                            fish.

                            released into the wild have become an invasive pest in parts of North America and
                            Australia.[4][5]

                            Native to China, the goldfish is a relatively small member of the carp family (which also
                            includes
                            the
                            Prussian carp and the crucian carp). It was first selectively bred for color in imperial
                            China more
                            than
                            1,000 years ago, where several distinct breeds were developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly
                            in size,
                            body shape, fin configuration, and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow,
                            orange, red,
                            brown, and black are known).

                    Various species of carp (collectively known as Asian carp) have been bred and reared as food fish
                    for
                    thousands of years in East Asia. Some of these normally gray or silver species have a tendency to
                    produce red, orange, or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in Imperial China, during
                    the
                    Jin dynasty (266-420).[6][7]

                    During the Tang dynasty (AD 618-907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and water
                    gardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver
                    coloration. People began to selectively breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety,
                    keeping
                    them in ponds or other bodies of water. On special occasions at which guests were expected, they
                    would
                    be moved to a much smaller container for display.[8][9]</p>

                    <i>Wild goldfish typically grow to between 4.7 inches (12 cm) and 8.7 inches (22 cm) but can reach
                        16
                        inches (41 cm).[18] The size of pet goldfish depends upon its breed.[19]

                        As of April 2008, the largest goldfish in the world was believed by the BBC to measure 19 inches
                        (48
                        cm), in the Netherlands.[20] At the time, a goldfish named "Goldie", kept as a pet in a tank in
                        Folkestone, England, was measured as 15 inches (38 cm) and over 2 pounds (0.91 kg), and named as
                        the
                        second largest in the world behind the Netherlands fish.[20] The secretary of the Federation of
                        British Aquatic Societies (FBAS) stated of Goldie's size, "I would think there are probably a
                        few
                        bigger goldfish that people don't think of as record holders, perhaps in ornamental lakes".[20]
                        In
                        July 2010, a goldfish measuring 16 inches (41 cm) and 5 pounds (2.3 kg) was caught in a pond in
                        Poole, England, thought to have been abandoned there after outgrowing a tank.[21] On November
                        16,
                        2020, a 15-inch (38 cm) goldfish weighing 9 pounds (4.1 kg) was found in a 16 acres (6.5 ha)
                        lake in
                        Greenville, South Carolina, while conducting a population survey of Oak Grove Lake.[22]
